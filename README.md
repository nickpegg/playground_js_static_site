# js_static_site

This is me screwing around with the idea of a static blog website where blog posts are all in a single JSON file and the entire website is a single HTML file with some JS to pull posts out of the JSON blob.

Permalinks should be handled, like:
`/posts/2017/my_cool_post.html` is actually `/index.html` but the JS gets all `my_cool_post` from the JSON
